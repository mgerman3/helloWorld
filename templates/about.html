    <h2> Academic </h2>
        <p> I am a student at the <strong>University of Maryland</strong> majoring in accounting and information systems with a
            minor in technology entrepreneurship and corporate innovation. I am a senior graduating in May 2023.
            Overall, I have enjoyed my time at the University and made a number of friends. I have also taken a
            lot of courses. Below are my top 4 favorite classes:

    <h2> Personal </h2>
        <p>
            I was born on <em>November 6, 2000</em> in Massachusetts. I have lived in Massachusetts for my entire life. I grew
            up with both my parents and my brother. Growing up I enjoyed playing outside and being active with my
            friends. None of my close friends ended up attending the University of Maryland, but I try to stay in
            contact with them and meet up over school breaks. Below is a list of my best friends (in order):
        </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Joe</li>
        <li>Steve</li>
        <li>Billy</li>
    </ol>
